st.write("*GHGs:* Greenhouse gases are those gases in the atmosphere that are responsible for trapping heat coming from the Sun.") 
st.write("*Fossil fuel:* A hydrocarbon deposit, such as petroleum, coal, and natural gas, that is extracted and burned for energy")
st.write("*Carbon dioxide (CO₂):* A colorless, odorless gas that occurs naturally in the atmosphere as well as being a byproduct of burning fossil fuels, changing land use such as deforestation, and various industrial processes.")
st.write("*Methane (CH₄):* A potent GHG is a constituent of natural gas and is emitted by combustion of fossil fuel, agriculture, and anaerobic decay of organic matter in wetlands.")
st.write("*GHG source:* Any process, such as combustion of fossil fuel, that releases GHGs to the atmosphere.")
st.write("*GHG sink:* A process that removes GHGs from the atmosphere, such as the photosynthetic activity of plants, which absorbs CO₂.")
st.write("*Global carbon budget:* The net balance between global carbon sources and sinks that yields the atmospheric concentration of CO₂.")
st.write("*Total carbon budget:* The net amount of anthropogenic CO₂ emissions compatible with a particular warming limit.")
st.write("*Top-down estimates:* GHG estimates based on atmospheric observations.")
st.write("*Bottom-up estimates:* GHG estimates based on land and ocean models or activity data.")
st.write("*Lateral fluxes:* Carbon that is transferred between sources and sinks-but not necessarily leaving the biosphere-before deposition; such lateral fluxes in this report include river transport of soil carbon, agricultural product flow from farm to consumer.")
